 abstract = {Depth map is a crucial component in various 3D applications. However, current available depth maps usually suffer from low resolution, high noise, random and structural depth missing problems due to theoretical, systematic or hardware limitations. In this paper, we propose a novel method to enhance depth map with the guidance of aligned color image, tackling these problems in a whole framework, where a hybrid strategy on filling hole geometrically by the combination of joint bilateral filtering and segment-based surface structure propagation is introduced. Our experimental results prove the proposed method outperforms existing methods.},
