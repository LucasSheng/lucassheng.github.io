 abstract = {We propose a real-time method to accurately track the human head pose in the 3-dimensional (3D) world. Using a RGB-Depth camera, a face template is reconstructed by fitting a 3D morphable face model, and the head pose is determined by registering this user-specific face template to the input depth video.},
